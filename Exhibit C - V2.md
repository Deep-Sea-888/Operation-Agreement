## The Tangle Community Treasury Committee Specification

*This is the full specification for all operational processes and ordinary and usual decisions concerning the business affairs of the Tangle DAO LLC while operating the Tangle Community Treasury grant committee. Detailed rules and procedures are defined here.*
---

## 1.0 Introduction Tangle Community Treasury Committee - Operation Specification

The Tangle Community Treasury committee was established in the Governance Votes [SGP-005](https://govern.iota.org/t/sgp-0005-shimmer-community-treasury-grant-committee/1576), the committee members got selected in [SGP - 001](https://govern.iota.org/t/sgp-0001-shimmer-community-grant-committee-lead-selection/1544/1) and [SGP - 002](https://govern.iota.org/t/sgp-0002-shimmer-community-grant-committee-grant-reviewer-selection/1546) by the Shimmer Token holders. A follow-up community vote was conducted ‘n’ (hyperlink to vote) months after the grant committee operated a couple of months, and they proposed some updates and revisions they found would help create a more efficient and beneficial framework. The specification below is the legal, operational document in which the Tangle Community Treasury grant committee and Tangle DAO LLC members must manage and operate any assets the IOTA & Shimmer community allocates through a purpose-bound governance vote.

## 2.0 Definitions  

In this Agreement: 
 
**“Purpose Bound or Purpose Bound Allocation”** means that the community may decide to form new DAOs or support funding arrangements above and beyond the Tangle Community Treasury. Some decisions may require a legal entity to sign contracts, issue funding, or other unknown reasons. Such a decision by the community would only be completed through a community governance vote. Upon which the IOTA and Shimmer Community funds would be transferred to the Tangle DAO LLC. These funds would be transferred with a specific purpose bound to such funds. The committee, which manages the Tangle DAO LLC, shall govern the assets allocated by the community only for the purpose bound by the governance vote.

**“Tangle Community Treasury”** means assets to include $SMR, $IOTA, or other assets allocated by the IOTA & Shimmer community to be managed by the Tangle Community Treasury grant committee.

**“Tangle Community Treasury Grant Committee”** means the committee members elected by the IOTA & Shimmer community through a governance vote to manage the Tangle Community Treasury assets.

**“Tangle DAO LLC”** means the legal entity formed in The Republic of the Marshall Islands, which offers liability protection to the Tangle Community Treasury grant committee and community. The initial formation of the LLC entity is focused on managing the Tangle Community Treasury grant committee. However, it is not limited to and can act as an entity to manage community asset purpose-bound allocations.

## 3.0 Specification

### _Mission of the Tangle Community Treasury Committee:_

_A community-led committee-based grant program to support the Shimmer and IOTA network while empowering the ecosystems_

### 3.1 The Committee

The committee will be set up with five members.

#### 3.1.1 One of them is the *Program Lead*, which, besides reviewing funding requests, takes care of all administrative tasks and reporting and coordinates the committee members’ work.

- The Lead also promotes the program, identifies directions for funding, and has a thought leadership role in guaranteeing the program’s success.
- The Lead is directly involved in grant reviews and decides which team of reviewers should work on a proposal.
- Further, an important part is ongoing coordination with the second ecosystem funding program run by the Tangle Ecosystem Association and the Shimmer Growth Committee to ensure effective alignment in the goals and directions of the community grants program.
- The Lead will organize weekly treasury working meetings with the co-lead and reviewers.
- The Lead will ensure all financial and asset accounting is completed in a timely and fully transparent maner. All fund or asset usage by the Tangle DAO LLC and Tangle Community Treasury must always be shown publicly.
- The Lead will complete quarterly transparent reports and publish them to the community.
- The Lead will act as the first public contact for anyone that wants to approach the committee besides funding requests.
- The Program Lead will be contracted by Marshal Island DAO LLC (to be set up), which acts as the legal body of the program and offers limited liability and the needed legal structure to ensure a safe operation.
- To establish this contract, the Program Lead shall have a legal entity (company, LLC, GmbH, etc.) set up in its home jurisdiction that will engage in agreements and manage the Tangle DAO LLC consultant in the Marshall Islands that registers and maintains the LLC.
- The Lead will be compensated by an amount stipulated in the annual governance vote conducted by the community if they decide to approve continued operations of the Tangle Community Treasury grant committee and/or the Tangle DAO LLC. 
- The Tangle DAO LLC will compensate the program lead based on providing a 40-hours-per-week max basis, and they will sign a 12-month service provider contract.
- The program lead will have 30 days of paid vacation that they may take at their leisure. The program lead must manage the treasury operations and adequately communicate with the co-lead and committee to ensure daily operations can continue smoothly and effectively. Their vacation should not impact the treasury grant committee’s daily activities negatively. The program lead should, if possible, be able to be reached in an emergency.
- The program lead will also have paid national holidays for their country; for example, if the Program Lead was registered in Germany, they would have holidays such as New Year’s Day, Ascension Day, Whit Monday, German Unity Day, and others.

#### 3.1.2 The *Grant Reviewers* will process funding requests part-time.

- The committee operates a 3 of 5 Gnosis multi-signature wallet that requires 3 out of 5 signatures for any operation (like spending funds or adding or removing members).
- The Lead will assign reviewers to work on proposals based on their qualifications, experience, and availability.
- Grant reviewers will operate on a service provider contract with the Tangle DAO LLC.
The grant reviewers will be compensated by an amount stipulated in the annual governance vote conducted by the community if they decide to approve continued operations of the Tangle Community Treasury grant committee and/or the Tangle DAO LLC. 
- The Tangle DAO LLC will compensate the grant reviewers based on providing a maximum of 10 hours per week, and they will sign a 12-month service provider contract.
- The committee members will select one of the four reviewers as the **Co-Lead**. The Co-Lead acts on behalf of the Committee Lead in cases of sickness, holidays, or leaving. If the Lead resigns, the Co-Lead continues the operation and organizes an election of a new Lead through a community vote.
- If the Programm Lead is unavailable/sick/on leave and the Co-Lead needs to fill this position, the Co-Lead will be compensated for this extra time at the same rate the program lead receives and can invoice up to 40 hrs per week.

### 3.2 The Tangle Community Treasury Grant Committee Term

#### 3.2.1 The grant committee will be approved by the community through a governance vote annually for a period of 12 months. The term will start on the day when the Firefly vote (Phase 3) results to continue the Tangle DAO LLC and/or Tangle Community Treasury and the chosen committee members. Each year before the end of the approved operating  period, the below decisions shall be made by a community governance vote.

- The community will decide to continue or end the Tangle DAO LLC and the Tangle Community Treasury grant committee through a community governance vote that the program lead or co-lead will initiate. This governance vote must be initiated a minimum of 6 weeks before the end of the approved period the committee is authorized to operate.
- If the community decides not to continue the Tangle Community Treasury grant committee or Tangle DAO LLC, the program and/or co-lead will work together to enable a graceful shutdown of operations and transfer all assets back to the community-controlled wallet addresses. 
- Further, the program and co-lead will ensure all legal obligations, including documentation, forms signed, and any registration fees or required taxes, are paid, and no legal obligations remain with the Marshall Islands. The Tangle Community Treasury or Tangle DAO LLC shall meet any legally bound contractual obligations, and any approved grants shall be funded by the Tangle DAO LLC or Tangle Community Treasury’s assets. The Tangle DAO LLC shall secure all costs for an operational shutdown before transferring all assets back to the community-controlled address or addresses. Suppose there are non-tokenized assets such as real tangible assets or fiat in Tangle DAO LLC bank accounts. In that case, such investments will be transferred back to the community as approved by a community governance vote.
- If the community votes to continue the Tangle Community Treasury and/or Tangle DAO LLC, the program and/or co-lead will support a smooth transition with the current or newly elected committee.”

#### 3.2.2 The community may replace members during the program’s period through a governance vote following the process described in the [Shimmer Governance Framework](./the-shimmer-governance-framework.md).

- Need for replacements may occur if committee members cannot dedicate sufficient time to the program. If they ask for a replacement for personal reasons, or if the community has valid concerns about the motivation and professionality of a member or has any proof of fraud, betrayal, or violation of terms.
- Grant reviewers are free to leave the position based on the terms stated in their contract. The grant receiver shall give a 4-week before leaving the committee.
- In case of serious violation of terms of the contract, like a breach of NDA, insider trading, or not disclosed conflict of interest, reviewers will be immediately discarded from the committee position by the program or co-lead and removed as signers of the multi-sig wallet.
- Replacement positions will be offered to the runner-up candidates of the committee selection process (Phase 3 results).

### 3.3 Requirements for Committee members:

- All committee members will do KYC to reveal and verify their identity and sign a legally binding contract (employment or service provider) with the Tangle DAO LLC.
- All committee members must reveal potential conflicts of interest to become committee members. They need to indicate if they currently are or have been in the past part of a team in a DLT project or have other connections or affiliations to projects or groups that could cause a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest policy needs to be accepted and signed.
- To ensure a committee structure that provides different views and makes decisions as unbiased as possible, the maximum number of committee members from a Project Team is limited to **one member per team**. In this sense, a Project Team is defined as any organization that causes a conflict of interest by being affiliated as a team member or earning a salary, payment for services, or commission from the project.
- A committee member cannot be involved in evaluating any proposal that would cause a conflict of interest. Other grant reviewers will handle such cases without involving the member that has the conflict. Conflicts of interest are not exclusion criteria for committee members in general; those conflicts need to be disclosed to the Committee Lead. The Program Lead will then exclude the reviewer from the decision-making process for specific grants that would cause a conflict of interest.
- The Programm Lead is prohibited from holding any paid position within a Crypto project.
- All members will sign NDAs and Insider Trading disclosures.
- All Committee members are required to operate the Gnosis Multi-Signature Wallet with a Ledger Nano or similar device.

### 3.4 Selection process for committee members and the Program Lead:

Each year the community will choose to either approve the committee members to continue operating the Tangle Community Treasury for another year or decide to have elections for new committee members through an electoral process. If the community chooses to have elections the [the selection process specification](https://govern.iota.org/t/community-grant-committee-selection-proccess-specification/1436) that describes the community-driven selection process will be followed.


## 4.0 Funding Priorities

### 4.1 Funding objectives:

- To increase the Shimmer and/or IOTA network’s utility and attract new builders.
- To promote Shimmer & IOTA and make them more visible and attractive in the DLT space.
- To enable projects to establish successful and profitable business models on Shimmer and or IOTA.

### 4.2 Target areas for grant funding:

Below is a general list of target areas for the Shimmer network. If the IOTA Foundation or community evolves the network to grow in a new direction, the committee will support such new development and progress visions.

- Applications and integrations (front-ends, Defi, Gaming, and other applications that use the Shimmer protocol on L1 or L2)
- Incentivizing established successful projects from different ecosystems to deploy their application on the Shimmer network
- Developer tooling
- Open source software development using Shimmer technology
- Analytics tools and dashboards
- Community Education
- Marketing and outreach initiatives
- Code audits
- Events, Community meetups, and hackathons
- Bounties

## 5.0 Guiding principles for funding decisions:

1. A proposal must be relevant to the Shimmer and/or IOTA network and its ecosystem.
2. A proposal that does not segregate individuals, organizations, or communities based on sex, race, color, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority or majority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation.
3. The committee will prioritize projects with the highest potential and positive impact on the ecosystem compared to the received funding.
4. The proposer or team must be capable of delivering the proposed project. Evaluating this is the responsibility of the committee.
5. All funded projects must be open source (under [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) or [Apache 2.0 license](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)). Projects in development must allow the grant committee to access any private repos for review. These projects will only receive 50% of the proposed budget until they fully open-sourced their code.
6. The requested budget must match industry standards for comparable tasks. If a proposal requests way above fair market value, the committee will dialogue with the team to request adjustments. The committee may reject the proposal or cut the funding to settle at fair market value.
7. If a project has already received funding from the Tangle Ecosystem Association or other grant funding programs, it cannot receive funding from the Tangle Community Treasury for the exact scope of work. But, the grant committee can grant additional funding for extensions or further developments of such a project.
8. A proposal that creates any conflict of interest from members of the proposing team or committee members must be reported to the committee Lead. Committee members with conflicts of interest cannot process, comment, or vote on a proposal.
9. Any attempts of Bribery or offer of future payments, token ownership, or compensations/gifts of any form to committee members will immediately cancel a proposal process. Accepted bribes by committee members will lead to the immediate removal of the members from the committee.

## 6.0 Application and approval process:

Easy and quick access to funding is essential to a successful grant program. Numerous examples in the space have shown that this is one of the most critical reasons teams consider when choosing a network.

### 6.1 Funding Tiers and requirements:

As long as the market cap of Shimmer is depressed no grants should be given out to avoid immediate depletion of the Treasury. For this reason, if the market cap of Shimmer is ***below 50 Million USD***, then no funding will be approved. When the market cap is above 50 million USD, the below tier structure shall be followed.

- **Tier 1 - up to 5.000 USD**: Two reviewers handle the proposal and approve or decline it within two business days after submission. KYC is required for one member of the project teams (the Grant submitter needs to do KYC and be a signer). The reviewers will decide based on the provided data in the application and especially consider if the submitter has a positive history in our community. As soon as funding is approved, the proposal will be funded within two business days after KYC is completed.
- **Tier 2 - Regular Tier 5.000 - 50.000 USD**: Two reviewers review the proposal. KYC is required for one member of the project teams (the Grant submitter needs to do KYC and be a signer). Projects considered to be approved can be invited to conduct a 1-hour interview with the reviewers of the proposal. A minimum of two milestones will be defined, and payments will happen based on these milestones. After completing the KYC process, the committee can pay up to 50% of the requested funding upfront.
- **Tier 3: Regular Tier 50.000 - 200.000 USD**: Same requirements as the previous tier apply. The Project Team must do KYC (3 members do KYC, including the Grant submitter and Project Team Lead, that will be the signer and the 3rd Person decided by the Grant Committee Lead). Additionally, applications need approval by the entire grant committee. Projects considered to be approved will be invited to present the idea in an extensive live interview with two grant reviewers and the Program Lead. A minimum of three milestones are defined, and payments happen based on these milestones.

  If the project is accepted, the Program Lead will assign one of the reviewers as a project steward. The steward is responsible for keeping close contact and doing regular (minimum every two weeks) checks with the project team. Milestones are reviewed by the steward and approved by the committee Lead. After completing the KYC process, the program can pay 30% of the requested funding upfront.

- **Tier 4: Regular Tier 200.000 - 500.000 USD:** The entire grants committee will review those applications—same procedure as in Tier 3. The Project Team must do KYC (3 members do KYC, including the Grant submitter and Project Team Lead, that will be the signer and the 3rd Person decided by the Grant Committee Lead). If the project receives funding, the final decision will happen in a **vote by all token holders**.
  - Suppose the grants committee supports that the community shall fund a Tier 4 application; it forwards this application to the community as a proposal in the governance forum and asks for approval by the community in a vote by all Shimmer token holders.
  - The committee lead will submit the proposal in the governance forum and includes the project team’s full proposal and a detailed statement by the grant committee on why it recommends funding this proposal. Such a proposal will enter the governance process as a Phase 2 Poll in the Governance Forum.

### 6.2 Application and scoring process

Grant receivers shall fill out the online [web form](https://www.tangletreasury.org/airtable-proposal-form) found on www.TangleTreasury.org. Additional grant submitters should also submit an attached proposal. The committee provides a [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1thG3OukVMz9UMxlWHGMdUfmMizI0n1iA/edit) for any submitters that don’t have a custom form themselves.

#### Grant evaluation scoring system:

Grant reviewers will use a scoring system to evaluate funding proposals.

A project should reach a particular score to be eligible for certain funding Tiers:

- **Tier 4** (Funding budget 200.000 - 500.000 USD) - required score *minimum 17 of 20*
- **Tier 3** (Funding budget 50.000 - 200.000 USD) - required score *minimum 15 of 20*
- **Tier 1 & 2** (Funding up to 50.000 USD) - required score *minimum 13 of 20*

### 6.3 Possible Extra Scoring Points:

- Projects offer 0,5% of the project’s total token supply to go to the community Treasury: *One extra point can be granted.*
- Projects offer 1% of the total token supply to go to the community Treasury: *Two extra points can be granted.*
- Projects offer more than 1,5% of the project’s total token supply to go to the community Treasury: *Three extra points can be granted.*

*This does not imply that automatically such an offer will lead to granting the extra points. Granting these additional points is decided on a case-by-case basis.*

The scoring system is a guideline for reviewers. It may only sometimes apply to some kinds of projects.

We reserve the ability to place specific projects into different tiers even if point scoring disagrees. Still, this scoring system should apply to the majority of projects.

### 6.4 Grant Transparency

All grants will be shown publicly and transparently to the community through the www.TangleTreasury.org website when they are under review and their results upon completion when the committee finishes its assessment. All grant receivers and community members are free to reach out to the committee, particularly the Program lead, with questions or discussions at any time”.

The Tangle DAO LLC will transparently host a database through the www.TangleTreasury.org website. On this or any future website, all proposals shall be transparently listed, and a running accounting sheet that can be publicly audited to show the Tangle Community Treasuries assets and value transactions.

## 7.0 Complaint process:

Should a project feel it has been treated unjustly by a decision of the grant committee, it should first contact the Programm Lead and try to resolve the issue. Suppose the project representative does not reach a successful resolution. In that case, they can open a complaint thread in the Governance forum at www.govern.iota.org and explain the reasons for the complaint while being professional and respectful to the community.
If a Grant Reviewer is also a Governance Forum Moderator, this moderator is excluded from any moderation activities in this specific forum conversation.

## 8.0 The Budget

### 8.1 Budget for 12 months of operation

- The Budget for the committee spending during 12 months is decided annually by the community through a governance vote. All disbursements from the community treasuries to the Tangle DAO LLC will be listed in public address and a financial audit log on the www.TangleTreasury.org website.
- The committee will manage the assets provided to the Tangle DAO LLC by a purpose-bound allocation from the community using a MultiSig Wallet with a 3 of 5 signature approval process.
- The committee will pay monthly salaries in USDT or USDC when available, and the liquidation process allows. It is allowed for the committee to issue other asset payments as salaries if committee members so request it. The committee will always record such value transactions publicly on the treasury website.
- Liquidating any assets by the committee shall be done following the liquidation process.
- The committee shall liquidate the treasury assets into USDT or USDC for grant payouts. The Program Lead will manage the Treasury’s finance forecasting quarterly and bi-annual grant payouts to avoid risks of market volatility so that negative price impacts do not affect grant receivers and the Treasury’s operational costs.
- The committee shall liquidate the treasury assets to pay for non-salary operational costs such as, but not limited to, the Marshall Islands registration fees, legal fees, KYC fees, and other operating expenses. At the end of the committee’s term, the program lead will conduct a financial forecast for the coming year, including an extra $50,000 USDT/USDC for unknown non-salary operating costs.
- The Program or co-lead will promptly create public quarterly transparent reports and issue them to the community.
- Any excess assets left in the Committee’s MultiSig Wallets at the end of the committee’s term determined by the community will be sent back to the Community Treasury wallet by the committee members in case the community decides not to continue the program.

## 9.0 The legal entity

The committee members must have a legal status to be aligned with all regulations and operate safely and legally.

- The Program and co-lead will maintain all binding contracts and registration fees to ensure that the Tangle DAO LLC is always in a good and active legal status while the committee or other activities the community has bound to the Tangle DAO LLC to operate.

- The Committee Lead and the Grant reviewers will sign Service Provider contracts with the Tangle DAO LLC and receive legal liability protection from the entity based on these service contracts.

- All committee members, backups, or consultants that conduct grant reviews for the Treasury will KYC with the treasuries approved KYC provider. All members will be held responsible for any misbehavior occurring based on their contractual terms.

## 10.0 Program success metrics

Measurable criteria:

- Growth in the number of grants applications received quarter-over-quarter
- Growth in the number of projects, ideas, and events funded
- Growth in community engagement (e.g., increased activity on Discord, Forum, Twitter followers, etc.)
- Growth in Shimmer market capitalization that is driven by applications/projects funded via grants (e.g., increased TVL in the EVM Chain, increased amount of daily/weekly active users, increase in daily active addresses in the Shimmer network and the EVM Chain, increased value transferred due to apps funded by grants)

The committee will provide reports on these metrics every three to six months.

## 11.0 Changes to this Framework

If the community decides to approve the committee for another year of operation, the members of the Treasury committee can then begin daily activities. Even if we now think that we have designed a comprehensive and very well-working set of rules under which the committee members can carry out operating the treasury operations and manage the Tangle DAO LLC, the committee members may conclude that specific points described in this Framework need revising to function better and more effectively.

The committee members will be the only ones who can correctly identify the need for such changes. Therefore, we would limit the group of Persons that can propose changes to the specifications described in the document to the five elected Committee members.

The following points are open to changes by all community members via the official Shimmer Governance process:

   - Proposal to replace/remove the Programm Lead  
   - Proposal to replace/remove a Grant Reviewer
   - Proposal to terminate and shutdown the Tangle Community Treasury grant committee
   - Proposal to terminate and shutdown the Tangle DAO LLC
   - Proposal to extend the operation period of the Tangle Community Treasury grant committee
   - Proposal to add additional funding to the budget of the Tangle Community Treasury grant committee throughout the year
   - Proposal to manage additional assets for the community by a purpose-bound directive given to the Tangle DAO LLC 

All changes to other points described under this specification of this document can only be proposed by a member of this Shimmer Community Treasury Committee (Programm Lead and the four elected Grant Reviewers) through a public proposal in the Governance forum following the process laid out in the ***Shimmer Governance Framework***.
