## About

This repository contains governance documents that were collectively created by the IOTA and Shimmer community, with the support of the IOTA foundation. The community voted to adopt these frameworks as the operating processes and procedures for conducting Shimmer governance and managing the Shimmer community treasury.

  - [Exhibit B](https://github.com/Tangle-Community-Treasury-DAO/Operation-Agreement/blob/main/Exhibit%20B%20-%20V1.md): Shimmer Governance Framework
  - [Exhibit C](https://github.com/Tangle-Community-Treasury-DAO/Operation-Agreement/blob/main/Exhibit%20C%20-%20V1.md): Shimmer Community Grant Committee Specification

These exhibits are constitutive documents that establish the Tangle DAO LLC operating agreement for the Shimmer community treasury LLC (Tangle DAO) formed in the Republic of the Marshall Islands.

## Contributions

The community welcomes contributions and recommendations to further develop the governance and treasury frameworks. However, any changes that alter the intent of Exhibit B and Exhibit C must be completed by following the procedures outlined in Exhibit B. After a successful phase III community vote, a pull request can be submitted to update the exhibits in accordance with the community's agreed consensus.

Minor revisions to this legal document, such as correcting typographical errors or formatting inconsistencies, may be made without community approval. However, any changes that affect the substantive meaning or purpose of the document must be approved by the appropriate parties.
